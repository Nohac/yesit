# README for yesit

`yesit` is an open-source tool written in Rust, designed as an enhancement to the classic Unix `yes` command. While retaining the simplicity of `yes`, `yesit` extends its functionality to support interactive applications by automatically responding to prompts.

## Features

- **Customizable Output:** Specify any string as the output instead of the default "y".
- **Adjustable Interval:** Control the frequency of the output with a customizable interval.
- **Interactive Application Support:** Designed to work seamlessly with interactive applications, sending the specified output to prompts automatically.
- **Command Execution:** Execute any command or script and interact with its prompts using `yesit`.

## Requirements

- Rust
- Any system that supports Rust and the dependencies mentioned in `Cargo.toml`.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system.
2. Clone the `yesit` repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Navigate into the `yesit` directory:
   ```sh
   cd yesit
   ```
4. Build the project using Cargo:
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```
5. The executable will be located in `target/release/`.

## Usage

```sh
yesit [OPTIONS] -- [COMMAND]
```

### Options

- `-p`, `--prompt <PROMPT>`: The string to output. Defaults to "y".
- `-i`, `--interval <INTERVAL>`: The interval between outputs. Defaults to "500ms". Accepts human-readable time formats.
- `[COMMAND]`: The command to execute and interact with. Must be specified after `--`.

### Example

Automatically agree to all prompts with "yes" every second for a script:

```sh
yesit -p yes -i 1s -- ./your_script.sh
```
